This project is designed to automate key functionalities of the Shady Meadows B&B website, including booking, message submission, and user experience (UX) validations.
The automation framework is built using Selenium WebDriver, Java, Maven, and TestNG. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to promote reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
To support efficient collaboration and version control, GitHub is used for source management. Maven handles dependency management and project structure. The use of POM, along with modular test design, minimizes code duplication and enables easy integration and sharing across teams.
